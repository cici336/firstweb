Abstract The current new coronavirus has swept the world for more than half a year, and there is still an increase of more than 1,000 cases in Canada everyday. In this paper, we explored the dataset about COVID-19 Cases in Toronto, which is a non-probability survey published by Toronto Public Health. We found that young people have a higher infection rate of COVID-19, and we also found the main source of infection is close contact.</description>
